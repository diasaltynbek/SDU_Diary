University representatives came to our school and gave a good presentation, after which I made my choice. At that time, SDU was a natural place for KTL graduates to continue their studies in Kazakhstan.
Education was in English, so everyone wanted to go there. We did not know what bribes were, there was not a single case or hint of collecting money. We had good friendly relations with the teachers. Students could come to their offices with any questions. I graduated from Suleyman Demirel University in 2007.
The concern of teachers towards students was felt everywhere and always. This gave a special atmosphere of kinship, brotherhood, friendliness and mutual loyalty within the university. In my time, 50-60% of students were KTL graduates, so we quickly found a common language with everyone.
I was a socially active student, co-founder of an intellectual club. We organized debate tournaments, chess tournaments, brain rings, and held business conferences. I gained experience in organizational matters. The university gave me many friends - decent, patriotic, ambitious and caring. Integrity is about my friends from university. What I appreciate most is this.
Most of my friends, colleagues and business partners are SDU alumni, so I am literally surrounded by them. We love and are loyal to our university, and are not indifferent to everything that happens there. We periodically prepare maklube, a dish brought to Kazakhstan by Turkish citizens. University graduates are strongly represented in the IT field.
I am the managing partner of BeInTech Ventures, the venture capital arm of BI Group. We invest in startups in Kazakhstan, Russia and the USA. My friends and I are also involved in projects in the field of retail, logistics and real estate, for example, I am one of the distributors of Coca-Cola in Kazakhstan. But most of all I am known as the founder of the SmArt.Point technology hub in Almaty."

          During my school years, I did not think about entering SDU. After graduation, I just came to see the SDU campus, I immediately liked its warm aura. Without thinking about anything, I took my documents from KBTU and submitted them to this university. I am a graduate of 2017, graduated from the Faculty of Engineering with a degree in computer and technical education.
          At university I was actively involved in student life. She was the director of a charity club for girls. I really cared about this matter. It opened up my love for children and education. I am glad that I studied computer technology and software, but, unfortunately, I only worked in it for about a month.
          Thanks to the SDU teachers, I realized that a person should do what he loves. The teachers always treated their work with love - this created a positive atmosphere.
          In my third year, our dean, Meirambek Zhaparov, heard me sing, after which he sincerely and persistently advised me to take up singing and open a channel on YouTube. This inspired me a lot. There are many more examples where teachers sincerely helped students.
          First of all, I made good friends. At the beginning of my entrepreneurial activity, I received great support from friends, mainly from university. Someone provided upholstered furniture from their store for free, someone helped with the creation of a website, logo and other things. I am immensely grateful to them.
          It’s easy to recognize a SDU graduate - we have our own slang and special jokes that only we understand. We still communicate even with older graduates.
          At the moment I am the head of the educational center “Q-adam” @qadamaktau, also a representative of the “Intellectum” system @intellectumkz in the city of Aktau. In addition, I am the co-founder of the clothing line “Aitu”."

          In 2005, I graduated from the Physics and Mathematics Lyceum and was planning to enter the University of St. Petersburg. But at the last moment I decided to stay with my family in Kazakhstan. After good feedback from classmates who took the exam at the university, I decided to look at the university.
          At that time, the university was a building that looked more like a kindergarten or a dormitory. I didn't like the appearance. On the territory of the university I plunged into a new atmosphere for myself. I was surprised by the mentality of the students. These were guys of different nationalities who spoke only English and discussed smart things. At the university, I saw a different attitude towards deans and teachers. There was no strong hierarchy. The dean of my future faculty came to meet me and invited me to tea. The dean was Fuad Gadzhiev, now the entire IT community of Kazakhstan calls him dad. He largely influenced the choice of university.
          The teachers basically spoke to us only in English, even outside of class hours. After classes, none of the students went home. Many people went to the library; we liked to gain knowledge. In addition to knowledge, the university provided a platform for personal development. We have many organizations and interest clubs.
          The students around me were motivators. I saw their achievements and potential. We received the level of knowledge to work in large foreign companies. At the Faculty of Engineering, in the fourth year, 90% of our class got a job. And especially for us, the couples were moved to the evening.
          We have a large community of SDU alumni. We actively communicate in common groups on social networks. And if someone needs help, the first thing they will do is write to alumni groups.
          For each of the graduates, maklube is associated with a large number of friends and a holiday. Turkish phrases, sayings and jokes often come up in everyday life among graduates. Current students often invite us to events.
          
          It is believed that the strongest IT specialists in the Kazakhstan market are SDU graduates.
          Today I am the head of an IT company. We develop business automation systems, mobile applications, websites and online stores. We work closely with the university, employing students for work and internships."

          I am a graduate of KTL and the choice of university was not difficult for me. My priority was universities with English as the language of instruction. And I entered the Suleyman Demirel University at the Faculty of World Economics.
          There are only warm memories of our training program. Our student years passed easily and comfortably. We had a close-knit group, we helped each other master the subjects.
          The specificity of Kazakh-Turkish education is in the individual approach to each student. And to this day, former teachers remember us and know us by name. Four years ago, graduates and I visited the university and were surprised by the same atmosphere of warmth and care.
          Classmates are not just people with whom you study, but to this day they are close friends, colleagues, part of the family. The university taught us support and the need to treat each other with an open mind. This helps us in life and allows us to quickly make new acquaintances. We feel like we are part of something big. There is a proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone.” If you want to go far, go together” is what the university taught us.
          When I fly to Kazakhstan, I always meet with graduates. We are interested in learning about successes and helping improve projects. I am proud to be part of the SDU Alumni Association.
          I noticed that many successful millennials from Kazakhstan turn out to be graduates of KTL and SDU. These people develop within their own country as well as abroad.
          I head the department for promoting innovative technologies within the framework of artificial intelligence and cloud solutions at the largest American corporation Oracle. I also work in 17 different countries, from the CIS to South Africa."

          I am a graduate of Karaganda KTL, and we knew well about SDU. I didn’t plan to apply, but the university invited me after participating in the Olympiad. I heard good feedback from students and decided on where to study.
          At that time it was a small university, which was located in a two-story building. Now this building houses the Suleyman Demirel College. When we arrived for the first time, we were greeted personally by the dean. The way he talked about his studies and prospects was captivating. At the university everyone knew each other, the atmosphere was family and friendly. It was easy to adapt in the first days of school.
          At that time, the IT industry in Kazakhstan was just gaining momentum. In the third year we were already working in parallel. The university helped ensure that students were employed. We gained practical skills at work, and consolidated our knowledge at the university.
          When we organized our company, clients noted our special approach. We have always tried to put ourselves in the human situation, understand the problem and find a solution. And I realized that this is exactly how we were treated at the university.
          SDU graduates are practical people. Coming out of university, a graduate knows what he wants and has the skills to work. Such people were valued for their readiness to work and knowledge of the English language. Technical documentation of the most advanced and latest technologies is in English. And we already knew how to work with it. At the university, we taught at the same time, and after graduation we came to lectures with students to pass on the knowledge that we received in production.
          The difference between SDU graduates is that for the most part they all work in Kazakhstan. I work together with graduates of our university. There are guys to whom I taught, we also keep in touch with them. The university itself organizes alumni meetings, and we are pleased to take part in such events.
          I work at BeInTech, where the manager, Bagdat Musin, is also a graduate of SDU. We develop software in the corporate sector, for example for BI Group. Before that, he worked in a company where we created software for schools, universities, courts in Kazakhstan, developed egov and other projects of a republican scale."
